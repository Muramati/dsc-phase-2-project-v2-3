KING COUNTY HOUSES DATA PROJECT.

In this project, we have been assigned the task to analyze the King County House Sales dataset to help a real estate agency understand the factors affecting the selling price of houses. The dataset contains data of houses sold in King County, Washington, USA between May 2014 and May 2015. As data scientists, our goal is to provide accurate and reliable information to homeowners about the potential increase in home value due to different factors. The insights gained from the analysis will help the real estate agency make better decisions and provide valuable advice to homeowners.

BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING:

The real estate industry is an essential component of the economy, and homeowners rely on the industry to provide them with the right information to make informed decisions. Homeowners are always looking for ways to increase the value of their properties, and understanding the factors that affect the selling price of houses is crucial. By analyzing the King County House Sales dataset, we aim to provide the real estate agency with the necessary insights to help homeowners understand and predict the real estate market.


We shall therefore use the data available to conduct an analysis guided by the business merit above.

Our main aim for this analysis is to help the real estate agency to have a better understanding of the real estate industry in King county and to help them come up with realistic sales targets and better pricing models.

MODELING:

We used the following regression models:

Simple Linear Regression model - Price vs Sqft_living 
 
Simple Linear Regression model - Price vs Sqft_above

Multiple Linear Regression model - Price vs other variables

REGRESSION RESULTS:

The multiple linear regression model is better than the two simple regression models as it had a higher Rsquared value. This shows that categorical variables had a positive effect on the prices as illustrated in the univariate analysis.

Therefore adding these variables to the predictive model made the model to be a bit stronger.

CONCLUSION:

In conclusion the real estate agency should review the sqft of the living space/ the ground above the basement when setting their house prices as there is a linear relationship between these variables.

Factors like the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, the living area and grade of the house have a positive effect on the house prices. Lastly, the house prices seemed to have increased in 2015 they should therefore consider inflation when setting house prices in the future.
